# Python++

It's Python, but better.

## Key features

1. No mandatory indentation *(yay!)*
2. Beautiful braces *(finally!)*
3. `true`, `false`, and `null` keywords *(no more confusion!)*
4. `++` operator *(hell yeah!)*

It's the Python upgrade we've all been waiting for!

## How to use

1. Install Python3.6 or higher
2. Run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/pythonplusplus.git
cd pythonplusplus
python ppp.py test.pp -o test
```

If the output says `test.ppc created successfully`, you've just compiled your first python++ program! If not, contact your local sysadmin for help.

3. To test your program, type:

```
python test.ppc
```
